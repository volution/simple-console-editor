About
=====


This is my personal plain text editor
that I have initially written in a couple of hot summer days of 2008.

Over the years I have made minor enhancements and stability improvements,
plus an initial implementation of a browser-like pager.

I have used it since the first days for all my edits,
especially for source code, scripting, configuration,
in all languages
from C to Go, Python to Scheme, Bash to Erlang,
HTML / CSS / JavaScript,
LaTeX to CommonMark,
JSON to XML,
all except Java.

The code is written in Python,
works with both Python 2.7 and 3.6+,
and is only a couple of tousand lines long,
~3.5k for the current version which includes a browser-like pager.
However on the down-side the code is quite a mess, but it gets the job done.

It has no dependencies outside
the basic Python runtime and the ``curses`` library.

It can be deployed as a simple single-file standalone executable,
and works on any POSIX-like system from Linux, to OpenBSD and OSX.
