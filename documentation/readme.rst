SCE -- Simple Console Editor

About
=====

This is my personal plain text editor that I have initially written in a couple of hot summer days of 2008.  Over the years I have made minor enhancements and stability improvements, and currently I am working on implementing browser-like pager functionalities.

I have used it since the first days for all my "edits", especially for source code in all languages from C to Go, Python to Scheme, Bash to Erlang, all except Java.

The code is written in Python (2.7) and is only a couple of tousand lines long, ~3.5k for the current development version which includes a browser-like pager.  However on the down-side the code is quite a mess, but it gets the job done.
